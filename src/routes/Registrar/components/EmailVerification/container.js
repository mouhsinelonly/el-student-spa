/*  Note: mapStateToProps is where you should use `reselect` to create selectors, ie:

    const tripleCount = createSelector(profile, (count) => count * 3)
    const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
      profile: tripleCount(state)
    })

    Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
    Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments change.
    Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.
